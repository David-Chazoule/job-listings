Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


## The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local data.json file, so you can use that to populate the content on the first load if you like.

Your users should be able to:

Filter job listings based on the categories selected
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
